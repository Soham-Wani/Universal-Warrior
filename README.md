# Universal-Warrior
Universal Warrior was a private Discord bot I made for the Discord server [The Dank Universe](https://discord.gg/sUPgd6TqEf) (Yep! That's some free advertisement).

## Information
It is not the best bot in the world.  And yes, I no longer work on it due to, academics ofcourse. What in the world could be the reason? 

It is made in a probably fairly uncommon language BDscript 2. The official documentation can be found [here](https://nilpointer-software.github.io/bdfd-wiki/foreword.html). I don't know whom it may help, but yes, it's out here.

## Notes to other developers
Notice how there are two warn commands in "Moderation Commands" file? They both have the same trigger `&warn`. You need to paste the codes for 2 seperate commands with the same trigger. 

Also `&timeout`, `&mute` and `&untimeout`, `&unmute` are just aliases, so yea!
